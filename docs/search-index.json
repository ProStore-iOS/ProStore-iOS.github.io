When you decide on which app to install, tap on the app, and click the Install button. If your VPN is on, and pairingFile placed correctly, the app should successfully install.\nIPA Files\nCurrently ProStore does not support installing apps by an .ipa file, although support will be added very soon. Until then, feel free to use the app store as there is over 1,000 apps available, and you can add more through app sources!\nApp Sources\nThe ProStore Store is made up of the following Esign/AltStore sources:\nApptesters Repository\nWuxu Complete\nWuxu Complete Plus\nSwaggyP TrollStore IPAs\nCypwn IPA\nQuantumSource\nQuantumSource Plus\nNeoncat TrollStore IPAs\nIf you wish to add more sources, go to Settings, and click Sources Manager. Here you can add, remove, or edit AltStore-format sources. They will immediately update and you can view them in the Store.\n"},"1":{"title":"Adding Certificates","id":"certificates/","text":"Certificates in ProStore\nBefore you can install any apps in ProStore, you must add a certificate to sign the apps with. To add a certificate, in ProStore, click on Certificates in the sidebar, and press the + in the top right corner of the app, and press Add from Official.\nIn the menu, select the certificate that you used to install ProStore, and tap Add Certificate, which will download it from the ProStore certificate repositoy on GitHub. Feel free to add as many certificates as you like. You are also able to add certificates from the files app if you have obtained the .p12 and .mobileprovision files.\nThe certificate will show the expiry date, and send a request to AppleP12’s P12 Checker to find out whether the cert is revoked or not, which will update after a couple of seconds.\n"},"2":{"title":"Anti-Revoke DNS","id":"dns/","text":"Install the Anti-Revoke DNS\nBy installing the Anti-Revoke DNS this prevents your apps from being revoked as frequently if apple revokes the certificate you installed ProStore with.\nTo install the Anti-Revoke DNS, on your iPhone or iPad, go to this link: https://github.com/esigncert/khoindvn/releases/download/DNS/signed_khoindvn.mobileconfig. A popup should appear, where you should click Allow, then Close.\nNext, go to Settings, and press Profile Downloaded. Tap the Install button, then enter your passcode if prompted and then press Install again. Finally, click the final Install button if asked again.\nMake sure to restart your device after installing the DNS, and now you are able to continue installing ProStore with hopefully no revokes!\n"},"3":{"title":"Welcome","id":"index.html","text":"ProStore Docs\nWelcome to ProStore, the best alternative app store and sideloading app for iOS!\n"},"4":{"title":"Installation","id":"installation/","text":"Install ProStore\nProStore Web\nThe first step to install ProStore, is to visit ProStore Web (https://prostore-ios.github.io) on your iPhone or iPad, and click Download and then Install, and then Install again once the popup appears. This will install ProStore, so you can go to your home screen to check if it’s installed. There may be a few outcomes from this:\nProStore will open and the Setup page will appear.\nAn Untrusted Enterprise Developer popup will appear.\nAn Unable to verify popup will appear.\n\nIf ProStore opens to the setup screen, continue to the Setup documentation. Otherwise, navigate the the specific outcome below.\nUntrusted Enterprise Developer\nIf you see the Untrusted Enterprise Developer popup, this is good as it means that the certificate is not detected as revoked, and will install as soon as you’ve trusted it.\nTo trust the certificate, go to Settings → General → VPN &amp; Device Management, and under Enterprise App, tap on the certificate and click Trust &quot;Certificate Name&quot; and then Trust. If another popup appears, you may have to restart your device, so press Allow &amp; Restart, and follow the steps to trust the certificate.\nNow the certificate will be trusted, and ProStore will open to the setup screen.\nUnable to verify\nIf you see the Unable to verify popup, this means the certificate that ProStore was installed with was revoked. Make sure you followed the Anti-Revoke DNS steps if you haven’t already, and then continue.\nUninstall ProStore before continuing, otherwise it won’t work to install ProStore with a different certificate as mentioned below.\nOn ProStore Web, press on Certificate Manager, which will bring you to the certificate manager page. If every certificate says Revoked and none are signed, you will have to just try installing ProStore with them and hope the Anti-Revoke DNS works. If there is a Signed certificate, remember what it’s called.\nGo back to ProStore Installer, and tap Advanced Installer. If there was a signed certifiate, select that in the certificate selection box. If not, try each certificate one by one. Click the Download button, and wait for it to download, and then press Install on this device and then Install, to re-install ProStore with the selected certificate. After every change of cert, remember to uninstall ProStore before re-installing.\nIf it still says Unable to verify, go through and re-install ProStore with each cert to see if any of them work. If none of them work, unfortunately you will not be able to install ProStore with an enterprise cert.\n"},"5":{"title":"Setup","id":"setup/","text":"Setup ProStore\nThe following steps are also the same as the steps in the ProStore app, just in more detail.\nInstall LocalDevVPN\nTo install LocalDevVPN, go to the App Store on your iPhone or iPad and search for LocalDevVPN, and install and run it.\nPlace the pairing file\nFirst of all, install iLoader for your operating system. You must use ProStore’s version of iLoader.\nWindows\nEither install iTunes from the Microsoft Store or Directly from Apple. Next, download the iLoader exe installer and run it.\n\nLinux\nFirst, install usbmuxd (using your package manager), and then install iLoader: Debian, Fedora, or AppImage.\n\nMacOS\nInstall iLoader for Mac here.\n\nThen, connect your iPhone/iPad to your computer, and then trust it. In iLoader, click Manage Pairing File, and then to the right of ProStore, click Place. Wait for the message: Pairing file placed successfully!.\nProStore Shortcut (Optional)\nThis step is optional, but recommended. It installs a shortcut which automatically turns on the LocalDevVPN VPN every time you open ProStore so you don’t have to manually turn it on every time. On your iPhone/iPad, go to this link: icloud.com/shortcuts/4ff18eec29304b6090a4a3f8d6a821b8, and install the shortcut.\nNow, go to Shortcuts and Automation. Press the + to add an automation, and click on App, then Is Opened, and tick Run Immediately. Click Choose, and select ProStore. Finally, click Next and choose the Turn on VPN shortcut. You have successfully setup the automation.\n"},"6":{"title":"Updating ProStore","id":"update/","text":"Updating ProStore\nUpdating ProStore is very simple. First, click on Updater in the sidebar, then press the Download button, and then press Install and wait for the dialogue to appear and click Install again. If ProStore successfully updates, you can open and keep using ProStore.\nSometimes ProStore will not update - you can see the version in About, and if it’s the same ProStore has not updated. This will happen if the certificate that the updater is using is not the same certificate that you used to install ProStore with. If this is the case, click on Advanced Installer and choose the certificate you used to install ProStore with originally, and update
